Hi there! My name is Anirudh, and I use he/him pronouns. I am a second-year graduate student pursuing a Master's in Computer Science at the <b>University of Massachusetts Amherst</b>. I previously graduated with distinction from Birla Institute of Technology and Science, Pilani (BITS Pilani), India, where I pursued a dual major (B.E. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Mathematics). I'm looking to explore the real-world applications of data science and machine learning, particularly in areas that fall at the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science. Specifically, I am interested in <b>Natural Language Processing</b> (including studying and evaluating the <b>factuality</b> and <b>hallucination</b> of large language models, <b>personalization</b> of these models, and their <b>multilingual and multimodal</b> capabilities) and the applications of <b>Computer Vision in medicine</b> (such as medical image analysis, autism detection, and psychological testing). I am currently working under the supervision of <a href="https://people.cs.umass.edu/~miyyer/">Prof. Mohit Iyyer</a> at the <a href="https://nlp.cs.umass.edu/">UMass NLP Lab</a> and have ongoing projects with <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/zamani/?_gl=1%2Ajpaw2l%2A_gcl_au%2AMTA4MjUyNTEyMS4xNzIzMDI2NTc0%2A_ga%2AMTc3MDAzNjE5Mi4xNjkxMTYwNDcy%2A_ga_21RLS0L7EB%2AMTcyNzIzMDIyMS4zMDMuMC4xNzI3MjMwMjIyLjAuMC4w">Prof. Hamed Zamani</a>, <a href="https://ken77921.github.io/">Dr. Haw-Shiuan Chang</a>, and <a href="https://alirezasalemi7.github.io/">Alireza Salemi</a> at the <a href="https://ciir.cs.umass.edu/">Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) Lab</a>, as well as with <a href="https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/dr-subrata-chakraborty">Prof. Subrata Chakraborty</a> at the University of New England, Australia.
