Hi there! My name is Anirudh, and I use he/him pronouns. I am an incoming Ph.D. student in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/" target="_blank">Cornell University</a>, where I will be advised by <a href="https://tagoyal.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Tanya Goyal</a>. My research interests are primarily in the field of Natural Language Processing. Some of the research directions I’m especially excited about include:
<ol>
  <li> <b>Factuality</b> – Ensuring trustworthiness and mitigating hallucinations by encouraging more causal inferences and fewer guesses, particularly in long-context and long-form text generation tasks.</li>
  <li><b>Instruction-following</b> ability of LLMs.</li>
  <li><b>Personalization, creativity, and human–AI collaboration</b> - How can we improve and evaluate creativity and personalization in LLM-generated text, and design better collaboration strategies that understand user preferences and intentions?</li>
  <li><b>Building sustainable and reliable evaluation frameworks</b> to test modern LLMs on the above aspects.</li>
</ol>


Previously, I completed my master's degree in Computer Science at <a href="https://www.cics.umass.edu/" target="_blank">UMass Amherst</a>. There, I was fortunate to collaborate with <a href="https://miyyer.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Mohit Iyer</a> on studying the impact of LLM quantization on long-context and long-form text generation scenarios, and with <a href="https://ken77921.github.io/" target="_blank">Dr. Haw-Shiuan Chang</a> and <a href="https://groups.cs.umass.edu/zamani/?_gl=1%2Ajpaw2l%2A_gcl_au%2AMTA4MjUyNTEyMS4xNzIzMDI2NTc0%2A_ga%2AMTc3MDAzNjE5Mi4xNjkxMTYwNDcy%2A_ga_21RLS0L7EB%2AMTcyNzIzMDIyMS4zMDMuMC4xNzI3MjMwMjIyLjAuMC4w" target="_blank">Prof. Hamed Zamani</a>, on evaluating creativity and instruction-following ability in LLMs. Even earlier, I graduated from <a href = "https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/" target="_blank">BITS Pilani</a>, India, with a dual major: B.E. in Computer Science and M.Sc. in Mathematics. As part of my undergraduate thesis, I worked for over a year with <a href="https://www.une.edu.au/staff-profiles/science-and-technology/dr-subrata-chakraborty" target="_blank">Prof. Subrata Chakraborty</a> at the University of New England, Australia, on projects involving computer vision for healthcare (such as medical image analysis, autism detection, and psychological testing).
