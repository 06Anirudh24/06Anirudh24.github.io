I am a second-year graduate student pursuing my Master's in Computer Science at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Previously, I graduated from BITS Pilani, India, where I pursued a dual major (B.E in Computer Science and MSc. in Mathematics). I'm looking to explore the applications of data science and machine learning in the real world and work in areas that fall at the intersection of Mathematics and Computer Science. In particular, I'm interested in Natural Language Processing (studying and evaluating the factuality and hallucination of large language models, personalization of large language models, and multilingualism and multimodality in large language models) and the applications of Computer Vision in medicine (medical image analysis, autism detection, psychological tests, etc). I am currently working under the supervision of Prof. [Mohit Iyyer][mohit] at the [UMass NLP Lab][nlplab] and have ongoing projects with Prof. [Hamed Zamani][hamed], Dr. [Haw-Shiuan Chang][hsc], and [Alireza][alireza] at the [Center for Intelligent Information Retrieval (CIIR) Lab][CIIR] and with Prof. [Subrata Chakraborty] at the University of New England, Australia.
