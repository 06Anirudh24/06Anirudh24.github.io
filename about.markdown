title: About Me
---

Hello! I'm Anirudh from the lively city of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chennai">Chennai</a>, India. Growing up, I was fortunate to spend a lot of time with my grandmother, who holds a special place in my heart. The moments we've shared are some of my most treasured memories. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading about astronomy and learning more about wildlife and marine life. I also love listening to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnatic_music#:~:text=Carnatic%20music%2C%20known%20as%20Karn%C4%81%E1%B9%ADaka,south%20Telangana%20and%20southern%20Odisha.">Carnatic music</a>. Whenever I can, I spend time playing cricket, swimming, or biking. Traveling excites me, and I love discovering new places and trying anything adventurous, such as trekking, snorkeling, scuba diving, and skydiving. I've been lucky to visit over 20 countries and explore many parts of India along the way. 

Looking ahead, I have a few goals that I'm really passionate about:

1. **Education Accessibility:** I hope to get involved in teaching and help make education accessible to people from poorer backgrounds. Teaching has always been something Iâ€™m passionate about, and I believe education can open doors and change lives.
2. **Animal and Marine Life Protection:** Having been involved with multiple NGOs in the past, I hope to establish my own organization dedicated to protecting animals and marine life.
3. **Adopting Puppies and Scuba Diving:** On a lighter note, I dream of adopting as many puppies as possible and getting certified as a professional scuba diver!
