#### Do Deep Learning Models Mimic Human Personality Traits? – An Empirical Study
![](docs/assets/ACIS.png)
<div style="text-align: justify;">
Two key aspects of artificial intelligence are its ability to make decisions and attempt to mimic humans. Decision-making in humans is, however not straightforward and depends significantly on the person’s mental state, personal biases, and personality. In this study, we attempt to empirically understand if deep learning image classifiers also exhibit such inherent biases or if they act neutrally in any given situation. To this end, we perform three experiments – left-brain right-brain test, psychological images test, and Rorschach’s inkblot test on eight different stat-of-the-art deep learning classifiers. A detailed analysis of the SoftMax probability scores is done rather than an analysis on measures like accuracy and F1. The experimental results suggested that most models work similar to a left-brained person, do not always predict the same class when given images consisting of multiple object classes, and usually detect larger objects rather than smaller ones. We believe that understanding these inherent biases would help future researchers take necessary actions while building image classification models.

#### Hidden and Face-like Object Detection Using Deep Learning Techniques – An Empirical Study
![](docs/assets/Hidden Face Detection.png)
<div style="text-align: justify;">
An essential aspect of artificial intelligence is how closely machines can mimic humans. One of the motivations for developing intelligent systems is human vision. While trying to recognise a class of images, it is as vital to distinguish the class of images from similar-looking objects and identify them in hidden places as it is to create bounding boxes and learn to localize the position of the object. Traditionally, deep learning models have performed exceptionally well in image classification and object detection tasks. In this work, we perform four experiments to train machines to distinguish between real faces and face-like objects and to recognise them. Nine state-of-the-art deep learning-based classifiers have been chosen to perform a comparative study on the designed experiments. Using these experiments, we establish that training models on real faces does not prepare them to identify face-like objects, and at the same time, training on face-like objects enables the models to detect face-like images even while hidden amongst other images. Despite work being done in the fields of camouflage detection and optical illusion detection, to the best of our knowledge, no work has been done in training and testing machines to distinguish between face and face-like objects with deep learning methods. This work could help researchers make better camouflage detection systems, perform context sensitive studies, understand the biases that various models possess towards certain classes of images, and have applications in real life such as military and self-driving cars.
